# Jakobshavn Isbrae 

## Repository Structure 
This repository is associated with the manuscript ‘A reassessment of the role of atmospheric and oceanic forcing on ice dynamics at Jakobshavn Isbræ (Sermeq Kujalleq), Ilulissat Icefjord’, submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface. The repository is split into three main folders: code, data, and figures. The code folder contains all the scripts used in (i) the processing/analysis, and (ii) the plotting of figures. The data folder contains the data required to run the scripts, and the figures folder contains the outputted plots.
