## Terminus Position 
This folder contains the terminus position shapefiles for Jakobshavn Isbrae (1990-2023). Terminus positions were manually digitised between 2022 and 2023 from SAR imagery, with two existing datasets used for the remaining timseries: (i) MEaSUREs Weekly to Monthly Greenland Outlet Glacier Terminus Positions from Sentinel-1 Mosaics (2015-2022; https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0781/versions/1), and (ii) MEaSUREs Annual Greenland Outlet Glacier Terminus Positions from SAR Mosaics (1990-2015; https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0642/versions/2). 

Terminus position change analysis was conducted using MaQiT (https://liverpoolgee.wordpress.com/maqit/), with the curvilinear box method employed. The centreline shapefile used and the MaQiT output CSV are provided. The script 'terminus_position_plot' uses this output CSV file to plot graphs of terminus position change over time.
