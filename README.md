## Terminus Position 
The 'terminus_position_MaQiT' folder contains the terminus position shapefiles for Jakobshavn Isbrae (2018-2023). Terminus positions were manually digitised between 2022 and 2023 from SAR imagery, for the purposes of this study. Those provided between 2018 and 2022 were downloaded from the MEaSUREs Weekly to Monthly Greenland Outlet Glacier Terminus Positions from Sentinel-1 Mosaics (2018-2022; https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0781/versions/1). 

Terminus position change analysis was conducted using MaQiT (https://liverpoolgee.wordpress.com/maqit/), with the curvilinear box method being employed. The centreline shapefile used and the MaQiT output CSV are provided within the 'terminus_position_MaQiT' folder. The script 'terminus_position' uses this output CSV file to plot graphs of terminus position change over time.
